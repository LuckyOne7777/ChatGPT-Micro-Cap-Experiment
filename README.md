# LLM Trading Lab
This repository started as a **6-month live micro-cap trading experiment** in which a large language model (ChatGPT) manages a real-money portfolio under strict, predefined rules.

What began as a single experiment has evolved into a **baseline framework** for studying how large language models behave as portfolio decision-makers.  
All historical data, research artifacts, and logs are preserved for transparency and auditability.

## Running Your Own Experiment

If you want to run your own AI-managed trading experiment, check out this framework I created for LLM research: [LLM Investor Behavior Benchmark - LIBB](https://github.com/LuckyOne7777/LLM-Investor-Behavior-Benchmark)

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves two primary purposes:

1. A **complete, forward-only record** of a live AI-managed trading experiment  
2. A **reusable foundation** for future AI-driven trading experiments built on the same structure

Historical artifacts remain unchanged. New experiments, analyses, and methodologies are layered on top without rewriting past results.

## The Concept

Every day, I kept seeing the same ad about having some A.I. pick undervalued stocks. It was obvious it was trying to get me to subscribe to some garbage, so I just rolled my eyes. 
Then I started wondering, "How well would that actually work?" 

So, starting with just $100, I wanted to answer a simple but powerful question: **Can powerful large language models like ChatGPT actually generate alpha (or at least make smart trading decisions) using real-time data?**

Today, this repo has evolved into so much more than simply chasing alpha.

## Why This Matters

AI is being aggressively marketed as a replacement for human decision-making across industries.  
Trading is a domain where mistakes are measurable, irreversible, and costly.

This platform tests those claims using:

- Forward-only decisions
- Full transparency  
- Publicly logged results

## Future Work

I am currently designing the future experiment over newly listed IPOs with monthly analysis on my [Substack](https://nathanbsmith729.substack.com/).

Also, I developing the general experimental framework I created for LLM research [LIBB](https://github.com/LuckyOne7777/LLM-Investor-Behavior-Benchmark) for the upcoming and all future experiments.
